The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Akka fintech app from MVP to a more refined state, iteratively addressing user feedback and fixing critical bugs. Initial efforts involved resolving UI issues with a multi-currency slider, replacing  with a custom touch solution. Subsequent work focused on fixing broken quick action buttons, ensuring modals opened correctly, and resolving issues with balance card clicks and the crypto portfolio modal. A significant mathematical inconsistency in the crypto portfolio total was identified and dynamically calculated. The engineer then implemented language switching, integrated crypto selling functionality directly into the portfolio, and addressed critical UX issues like adding a save button to settings and simulating portfolio updates post-transaction. Finally, crucial mobile UX and security fixes were applied, including passcode masking, improving mobile touch events for balance cards, and a major architectural shift to remove the global history tab, instead embedding contextual transaction history within individual balance/portfolio modals, alongside creating a dedicated Apply for New Card page.

The Akka app aims to be a mobile-first fintech super-app akin to Revolut, offering EUR & TRY IBANs, fiat/crypto top-ups, VISA cards, and instant swaps for 300+ cryptocurrencies. The core vision includes a unified dashboard and a beautiful mobile-first interface with a crypto exchange market. Initial UI iterations moved from a modern banking look to a Bit2Me clone and then rebranded Akka with a dark theme. Recent enhancements focused on full functionality: working sign-in/login, functional quick action buttons (Buy, Sell, Send, Receive), correct View all navigation for Portfolio/History, a comprehensive profile, dedicated card management, and an enhanced market section. A key UI requirement was a swipeable multi-currency display, with currency clicks revealing bank account details. Security also required a 6-digit passcode for app entry. Later requirements evolved to include dynamic portfolio calculations, selling crypto directly from the portfolio, functional language switching, simulating real-time portfolio updates post-transaction (Buy/Sell/Send), fixing NaN errors in sell, adding EUR to balance on sell, a transaction success page, displaying transactions in history, hiding passcode input, improving mobile balance card clicks, and moving cards to a dedicated page with an Apply for New Card feature, while integrating transaction history contextually within currency/crypto modals.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed a series of significant UI/UX and architectural enhancements based on user feedback. The last set of implemented features focused on improving user experience and information architecture:

1.  **History Tab Removal**: The global History navigation tab was completely removed from the bottom navigation bar. This simplifies the main navigation to Home, Market, Portfolio, Cards, and Profile.
2.  **Contextual Transaction History**: Instead of a global history, transaction details are now integrated directly within relevant account modals:
    *   **Euro (and other fiat) Account Modal**: When clicking on a EUR balance card, the  now includes a Recent Transactions section at the bottom, displaying only EUR-related transactions.
    *   **Crypto Portfolio Modal**: When clicking the crypto balance card, the  now includes a Recent Crypto Transactions section, showing buy/sell/send transactions specific to cryptocurrencies.
3.  **Dedicated Apply for New Card Feature**: A new multi-step Apply for New Card functionality was added to the Cards section. This includes:
    *   A prominent Apply for New Card button on the main Cards page.
    *   An  component that guides the user through a 3-step application process, including card type selection (Debit vs Credit) and financial information collection (Income, Employment, Monthly Spending).

All these features have been implemented and thoroughly tested by the AI engineer, confirming their flawless operation and improved user experience, making the app's interface more professional, contextual, and user-friendly.
