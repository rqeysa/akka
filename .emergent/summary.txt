The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Akka fintech super-app from concept to a feature-rich MVP. The development followed an iterative approach, starting with core banking/crypto features, then undergoing multiple significant UI redesigns to match specific user requests (e.g., Bit2Me clone, black theme, gradient logo). Key architectural decisions involved using React for frontend, FastAPI for backend, and MongoDB for data, with CoinMarketCap for real-time crypto data. The engineer adeptly handled complex UI/UX challenges, implementing sophisticated features like a comprehensive profile system, advanced transaction filtering, integrated card management (fiat/crypto cards), and a multi-currency portfolio slider. Authentication was a recent addition, followed by a 6-digit passcode for enhanced security. The work culminated in integrating  for improved multi-currency carousel navigation, currently addressing a horizontal swipe issue.

The user envisioned Akka as a mobile-first fintech super-app, akin to Revolut. Core functionalities included EUR & TRY IBAN balances, fiat/crypto top-ups, virtual/physical VISA cards, and instant swaps for 300+ cryptocurrencies. The initial MVP focused on a unified dashboard, fiat/crypto balances, instant crypto swaps, fiat top-ups, and a beautiful mobile-first interface, explicitly including a crypto exchange market. UI evolution was a major theme: first a modern mobile banking look, then a clone of bit2me app only, rebranded to Akka (English), and finally a black background with a gradient elliptical logo. Most recently, the user requested to finish the whole app by adding sign in and login pages, ensuring anywhere person click in button it should work, adding normal currency sending/receiving (IBAN/EUR/USD), making the Sell button red, fixing View all buttons to navigate to correct pages (Portfolio/History), implementing a comprehensive profile section (personal info, security, payment, docs, help, settings), a card section displaying card balances/spending, and refining the market (more coins, real-time prices, working search). Finally, the multi-currency section required redesign to be a swipeable slider, clicking a currency should show bank account info, and a 6-digit passcode for app entry was requested.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for mobile-first UI; custom CSS for branding.
- **Crypto Data**: CoinMarketCap API for real-time prices.
- **Environment Variables**: Strict usage of , .
- **UI Libraries**: Swiper.js for advanced carousel/slider functionality.
- **Image Handling**: Images like logos saved in base-64 format.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack setup: React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB as the database.



-   : This is the core FastAPI backend. It was initially rewritten to establish user management, crypto prices (CoinMarketCap integration), crypto swapping, portfolio, transaction history, and recently, authentication (login/signup). It manages all API endpoints and database interactions.
-   : Stores crucial environment variables such as  and  for secure backend operations.
-   : The central React component. This file has undergone extensive modifications throughout the development, including multiple UI rewrites (mobile banking, Bit2Me clone, Akka branding, dark theme, gradient logo), integration of authentication pages (login/signup forms, navigation), implementation of all Quick Action button functionalities (Sell, Send, Receive modals with crypto/fiat support), comprehensive profile system with sub-pages, history filtering, a complete card management system (debit/crypto cards), improved market section (more coins, search, real-time prices), and integration of a swipeable multi-currency portfolio slider with a 6-digit passcode entry. It handles all frontend logic and data fetching.
-   : Contains the primary CSS, heavily leveraging Tailwind CSS. It has been frequently updated to apply all design changes, including Akka brand colors, Bit2Me branding, the final black theme, gradient logo, and custom styles for new components like modals, profile sections, cards, and the currency slider.
-   : Stores frontend environment variables, notably , critical for frontend-backend communication.
-   : The main HTML file for the React application. Most recently, CDN links for Swiper.js and its CSS were added here to enable the new horizontal swipe functionality for the currency carousel.
-   : Lists Python dependencies for the FastAPI backend;  and  were noted additions.
-   : Manages Node.js dependencies for the React frontend.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **BaaS API Integration**: The user has repeatedly mentioned providing BaaS API keys to integrate after the current UI/UX and functional enhancements are complete.
-   **Horizontal Swipe Fix**: The current horizontal swipe implementation for the currency carousel needs to be fixed to ensure it only swipes horizontally and that click events don't interfere.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on enhancing the multi-currency balance display on the home page. The user requested to replace the arrow-click navigation of the balance carousel with full horizontal swipe/drag support (for both touch and mouse), with cards snapping to the nearest slide and indicator dots updating accordingly. Keyboard navigation (←/→) was to be retained for accessibility. The engineer opted to implement this using .

The implementation steps included:
1.  Adding  CSS and JavaScript CDN links to .
2.  Updating  to integrate Swiper, replacing the manual slider implementation, including  for Swiper initialization and modifying the HTML structure for the slider.
3.  Updating  to accommodate Swiper's styling and re-adding any inadvertently removed portfolio-related CSS.

Screenshots confirmed that  was partially working, with touch/mouse drag, smooth animations, keyboard navigation, and pagination dots all functioning. However, the user explicitly stated, this not what i wanted it shouldnt down it should be left like swiping, indicating that the swipe was either not purely horizontal or had issues, potentially due to click event interference. The AI engineer is currently addressing this specific issue by modifying the Swiper configuration to ensure proper horizontal swiping and prevent click handler interference.

<optional_next_step>
Fix the Swiper.js configuration in  to ensure the multi-currency carousel only supports horizontal swiping.
