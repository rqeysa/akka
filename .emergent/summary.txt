The AI engineer successfully enhanced the Akka fintech app through an iterative process driven by user feedback. Initially, the focus was on critical UI/UX fixes and architectural improvements. Key achievements included creating a custom multi-currency slider, implementing contextual transaction history within modals (removing a global history tab), and developing a multi-step Apply for New Card feature. Subsequent work addressed explicit user requests: reorganizing the home screen layout by repositioning the cards and portfolio sections, making portfolio items clickable to reveal detailed crypto information (including charts and trading options), enhancing the transaction success page design, and ensuring transfer/deposit buttons were functional. The final iterations involved redesigning the  to a modern banking interface and refining layout positioning and font sizes based on direct user feedback, including correcting accidental changes to quick action button sizes and re-ordering bottom navigation tabs. The approach involved reading code, modifying React components (), updating CSS (), and thorough screenshot-based testing, ensuring backend stability throughout.

The Akka app aims to be a mobile-first fintech super-app offering EUR & TRY IBANs, fiat/crypto top-ups, VISA cards, and instant swaps for 300+ cryptocurrencies. The core vision includes a unified dashboard and a beautiful mobile-first interface with a crypto exchange market. The application requires working sign-in/login, functional quick action buttons (Buy, Sell, Send, Receive), correct View all navigation for Portfolio/History, a comprehensive profile, dedicated card management, and an enhanced market section. A critical UI requirement was a swipeable multi-currency display, where currency clicks reveal bank account details, and app entry secured by a 6-digit passcode.

Current implementation includes:
- Dynamic portfolio calculations and crypto selling directly from the portfolio.
- Functional language switching and real-time transaction updates post-transaction (Buy/Sell/Send).
- Fixed NaN errors, added EUR to balance on sell, and implemented a transaction success page.
- Passcode input masking and improved mobile balance card clicks.
- Cards moved to a dedicated page with an Apply for New Card feature.
- Transaction history integrated contextually within currency/crypto modals, removing the global history tab.
- Recent layout adjustments and design refinements for consistency and user experience.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed a series of intricate UI/UX refinements based on the user's latest feedback, bringing the Akka app to its most current and refined state.

The work primarily revolved around:
1.  **Layout Refinements**: The home page layout was fine-tuned multiple times. Initially, cards were moved to the middle and portfolio after cards. Later, the user requested to swap them back, placing the portfolio first then cards, and finally, the layout was set to: Balance Cards → Quick Actions → **Your cards** → **Your portfolio** → Recent Activity, which is the current state.
2.  **Portfolio Number Sizing**: The font size of crypto values within the Your portfolio section (e.g., BTC: €14,865.25) was adjusted to be smaller and more readable, addressing the user's feedback that they were too big.
3.  **Quick Action Button Sizing Correction**: The Buy/Sell/Send/Receive buttons, which were accidentally resized during previous CSS modifications, were reverted to their original, intended size, ensuring visual consistency.
4.  **Bottom Navigation Tab Order**: The Cards and Portfolio tabs in the main bottom navigation bar were swapped to reflect the user's preferred order: Home | Market | **Cards** | **Portfolio** | Profile.
5.  **Design Consistency**: Extensive CSS adjustments were made across the application, especially to the Cards section and Portfolio items, to ensure all elements adhere to the established Akka app design language, maintaining consistent colors, typography, and hover effects.

The app's current state exhibits a highly polished and intuitive interface, with all previous features (like the Modern Bank Account Modal, Crypto Details Modal, functional quick actions, and contextual history) seamlessly integrated and visually consistent, providing a world-class fintech user experience.
