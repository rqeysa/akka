The previous AI engineer successfully launched the Akka fintech super-app MVP, implementing core banking/crypto features and iterating through significant UI redesigns based on user feedback (e.g., Bit2Me, dark theme). Key technologies include React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, with CoinMarketCap for real-time data. The recent focus involved transitioning the multi-currency portfolio from arrow navigation to a horizontal swipe, initially attempting . However,  introduced sizing and interaction issues, leading to its removal and a re-implementation of a custom, compact, manual swipe solution. Subsequent refinements addressed box inside a box UI, crypto card click functionality, and pagination dot spacing. The final observed task is fixing multiple broken quick action buttons and associated modals.

<product_requirements>
The Akka app is envisioned as a mobile-first fintech super-app, similar to Revolut. Initial requirements included EUR & TRY IBANs, fiat/crypto top-ups, virtual/physical VISA cards, and instant swaps for 300+ cryptocurrencies, centered on a unified dashboard and a beautiful mobile-first interface with a crypto exchange market. The UI evolved from a modern banking look to a Bit2Me clone, then rebranded Akka with a black background and gradient logo. Recent, detailed requests aimed to finish the whole app, encompassing fully functional sign-in/login, working buttons, normal currency sending/receiving (IBAN/EUR/USD), a red Sell button, correct View all navigation (Portfolio/History), a comprehensive profile section, a dedicated card management system, and an enhanced market section (more coins, real-time prices, search). The multi-currency display needed to become a swipeable slider, with currency clicks revealing bank account details, and a 6-digit passcode for app entry.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for mobile-first UI; extensive custom CSS.
- **Crypto Data**: CoinMarketCap API for real-time prices.
- **Environment Variables**: Strict usage of , .
- **UI Interaction**: Manual touch/swipe handling for carousels.
- **Image Handling**: Images like logos saved in base-64 format.

-   : Core FastAPI backend, managing user authentication, crypto prices (CoinMarketCap integration), crypto swapping, portfolio, transaction history, and all API endpoints. No direct functional modifications were observed in this trajectory, but its stability was confirmed by testing.
-   : Stores environment variables like  and  for backend operations. No modifications observed.
-   : The central React component handling frontend logic and data fetching. It underwent significant changes:
    -   Initially integrated  for the multi-currency slider.
    -   Later,  implementation was entirely removed due to sizing/swipe issues.
    -   Manual touch handlers (, , ) and state variables (, , , ) were implemented to enable horizontal swiping.
    -   Logic for  and  functions was updated to use the manual slide index.
    -   A new  component was added, along with its state (), and the  function was updated to display this modal when the crypto balance card is clicked.
    -   Logic for Quick Action buttons (Buy, Sell, Send, Receive) and related modal states (, etc.) was reviewed and modified, specifically fixing the Buy button to open its modal instead of redirecting. Duplicate variable declarations (, , ) were identified and removed.
-   : Contains primary CSS, heavily using Tailwind CSS. It was frequently updated:
    -   Initial styling adjustments for , , and  to reduce the size of currency cards.
    -   The  wrapper was removed to eliminate the box inside a box visual effect.
    -   New clean styles were introduced with a  class for a direct and integrated look.
    -   Adjustments were made to , , and  for a compact design.
    -   Increased margins and padding for  to improve spacing.
    -   New CSS styles were added for the .
-   : Stores frontend environment variables like . No modifications observed.
-   : Main HTML file. Initially,  CDN links were added here, but these would logically be removed after  was replaced with manual implementation, although explicit removal was not shown in this trajectory.

<pending_tasks>
-   **BaaS API Integration**: The user will provide API keys for BaaS integration after current UI/UX and functional enhancements are complete.
-   **Comprehensive Button Functionality**: Ensure all Quick Action buttons (Buy, Sell, Send, Receive), balance card clicks (bank account details, crypto portfolio), and Profile menu items navigate or open modals correctly, as reported by the latest frontend test.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing multiple critical frontend functionality issues discovered during a comprehensive application test. Specifically:
1.  **Quick Action Buttons**: The Buy, Sell, Send, and Receive buttons were not opening their respective modals.
2.  **Buy Modal**: The Buy modal was not functioning correctly, with the Buy button redirecting to the market tab instead of opening the modal.
3.  **Balance Card Click Modals**: Clicking on regular currency balance cards was not opening bank account details.
4.  **Crypto Portfolio Modal**: Clicking the crypto balance box was not opening the intended .
5.  **Profile Menu Items**: Navigation items within the Profile section were reported as missing or non-functional.

The AI engineer has identified the Quick Actions section in  and observed that the Buy button was incorrectly redirecting. Work is underway to correct the  handlers for these buttons and ensure the correct modals are triggered. This involved checking existing modal state variables and addressing duplicate declarations like  to ensure clean code integration. The engineer has just made a fix to the Quick Actions and is about to test its functionality.
